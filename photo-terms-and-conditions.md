1. _Copyright_. The Materials on the Service are protected
   by U.S. and international copyright laws, and are owned
   or controlled by Licensor, or the party credited as the
   provider of the Service. You agree to abide by all
   additional copyright notices, information, or
   restrictions contained in this Agreement or elsewhere
   throughout the Service.

1. _Restrictions_. The Service consists of selected content
   that Licensor identifies on the previous page as being
   available to you. You may download only those Materials.
   If you are a publisher, then Licensor grants to you the
   one-time right to publish the Materials in the print or
   online version of your publication for editorial purposes
   only. You may not include the Materials in an
   advertisement. If you are an individual not associated
   with a print or Web publication, you may only use the
   photos for non-commercial purposes. You may not publish
   or otherwise use the Materials in any other format or
   media besides print, including without limitation,
   electronic or optical media, Internet, cable, fax, or
   teletext *without express written permission from the
   Service*. You may not publish or otherwise use the
   Materials after the expiration or termination of this
   Agreement. You may not allow any third parties to use the
   Materials in any way. All rights not granted to you
   remain the sole property of and are reserved to Licensor.

1. _Credits_. All Materials that you publish must be
   accompanied by a proper copyright notice and credits in
   the exact form in which they appear on the Materials
   furnished by Licensor, or as otherwise specified by
   Licensor on the Service. 

1. _Alterations_. You shall not retouch, crop, modify or
   otherwise alter the Materials so as to distort the
   substance of the Materials. You shall indemnify and hold
   harmless Licensor and/or its affiliates (and those
   providing the Materials to Licensor) from any and all
   claims, damages, liabilities and reasonable costs and
   expenses (including attorneys fees) arising out of a
   breach or alleged of this provision or paragraph 2 above.

1. _Release Dates and Advance Materials_. You will honor all
   release dates and restrictions on advance Materials, if
   any, as noted on the Service.

1. _Responsibility_. Licensor further represents and
   warrants that none of the products, services or content
   provided or licensed by Licensor to Licensee hereunder
   infringes upon or violated any copyright, patent,
   trademark or other third party right and that the
   provision of the products and services contemplated
   hereunder shall comply with applicable law.  Licensor
   will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that
   the products, services or content provided or licensed
   hereunder doe not contain any disabling devices, viruses,
   Trojan horses, trap doors, back doors, easter eggs, time
   bombs, cancelbots, or other computer programming routines
   that will damage, detrimentally interfere with,
   surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any system, data
   or information.

1. _Force Majeure_. Licensor shall in no event be liable for
   any loss or damage to you nor shall this Agreement
   terminate by reason of non-delivery, delays or
   interruptions in the delivery of the Materials due to
   causes beyond Licensor's reasonable control or caused by
   third parties; provided however that any fees or charges
   due for non-delivery hereunder shall be equitably
   adjusted.

1. _Furnishing of Licensee's Publication_. If requested by
   Licensor, you will furnish one copy of the issue(s) of
   its publication in which the Materials are published to
   Licensor at no charge.

1. _Payment Obligations_

    * You will pay for any Materials downloaded pursuant to
      this Agreement regardless of whether you actually make
      use of the Materials, and for any amounts due even if
      you fail to download the minimum amount of Materials
      to which you are entitled for a particular period.

    * Your breach of this Agreement (including but not
      limited to a failure to pay the charges set forth in
      this Agreement which remains uncured for 30 days after
      Licensee receives written notice thereof) shall
      constitute an event of default which shall entitle
      Licensor to terminate delivery of the Materials and
      recover (i) arrearages; (ii) the remaining payments
      due under the Agreement less the savings realized by
      termination; (iii) interest at one and one-half
      percent per month for past-due amounts; (iv)
      reasonable costs and attorney fees incurred in
      collecting any past due amounts; and (v) any other
      remedies at law or in equity to which Licensor may be
      legally entitled.

1. _Registration and Security_

    * As part of the registration process, you have been
      assigned a password and a user name. You agree to be
      responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of
      this password. You have also provided Licensor with
      certain registration information, all of which must be
      accurate and updated. Should any registration
      information change, please notify Licensor at
      info@religionnews.com. You may not: (i) select or use
      a subscriber ID of another person or entity with the
      intent to impersonate that person or entity; or (ii)
      use a subscriber ID in which another person or entity
      has rights without such person's or entity's
      authorization. Failure to comply with the foregoing
      shall constitute a breach of this Agreement. 

    * You agree to notify Licensor of any known or suspected
      unauthorized use(s) of your account and/or the
      Service, or any known or suspected breach of security,
      including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of
      your password.

    * You agree not to tamper, alter or otherwise interfere
      with the Service.

    * You must be 18 years or older to subscribe to the
      Service.

1. _Indemnification_. Each party (the "indemnifying party"),
   at its own expense, will indemnify, defend, and hold
   harmless the other party and its officers, directors,
   employees, agents, parent companies, subsidiaries and
   affiliates and their respective successors and permitted
   assigns (collectively, the "indemnified party"), with
   respect to any third-party claim, loss, demand, cause of
   action, debt or liability, including reasonable
   attorneys' fees, arising out of or related to (a) any
   breach or alleged breach of its obligations,
   representations or warranties under this Agreement, or
   any willful, intentional or negligent action or failure
   by the indemnifying party, its employees or agents; (b)
   any actual or alleged patent or copyright infringement
   (including any contributory infringement claims),
   misappropriation of confidential information or violation
   of other intellectual or proprietary rights or licenses,
   including, without limitation, patent, copyright,
   trademark or trade secret rights, related to any
   materials or content provided or created by the
   indemnifying party under this Agreement; and (c) the
   indemnifying party's  business and operations.

1. _Assignment_. You may not assign this contract without
   the prior written consent of the Licensor, and any
   assignment without such prior written consent shall be
   null and void. In the event of a sale, transfer or
   consolidation of your publication, if any, you agree to
   cause the assignee or successor to expressly assume all
   of your obligations hereunder. Any assignment contrary to
   the above shall be null and void.
