By submitting stories, photos, audio, videos or other
content to a Religion News LLC staff member or through
Religion News LLC's online submission forms, I hereby agree
to the following terms:

1. You grant Religion News LLC/Religion News Service the
   exclusive worldwide right to resell and distribute the
   material in print, broadcast, electronic and all other
   media that exist now or may be developed in the future
   for the full term of copyright. This does not prevent you
   from recasting that material for other markets, so long
   as what you do for others is substantially different from
   what you have submitted to Religion News LLC. Work you
   submit to other media outlets may appear no sooner than
   10 days after Religion News LLC publishes your work.

2. The work is original and does not infringe upon the
   personal or proprietary rights of any third party.

3. The reporting is accurate and is in accordance with the
   highest standards of journalism.

4. Religion News LLC may edit, revise, fact check or update
   the material you submit to conform to our editorial and
   journalistic standards. By signing this agreement, you
   agree to cooperate fully with the process.

5. Because Religion News LLC is a non-sectarian source of
   faith and values news, it is your responsibility to make
   us aware of any actual or potential conflicts of interest
   in your work before such work is published. Failure to do
   so could nullify all contracts with Religion News LLC.

6. As a voluntary contributor, you are not eligible for
   monetary compensation or employee benefits as a result of
   the resale or distribution of your content.

7. Religion News LLC may use your name, likeness or examples
   of your work in our promotional, advertising and
   marketing efforts without compensation.
