This repository contains various Terms and Conditions
available at [ReligionNews.com][1] and its sister FAV sites
in [Spokane][2] and [Wilmington][3]. The purpose of the
repository is to allow visitors to see changes in the
documents over time. Updates to TACOS documents will be
pushed to the repository as soon as time permits.

The documents contain metadata designed for use with
[MultiMarkdown][4]. You can convert to HTML with
`multimarkdown -b`, or convert to LaTeX with `mmd2latex`.
The included `header.tex` provides basic formatting for
converting the `.tex` files to `.pdf` with `pdflatex`.
